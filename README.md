# Hi there 👋  I'm Andy!


I love to build intuitive solutions to problems of all shapes and sizes. Public repos within are strictly personal projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: fun AI-powered things ;)
- 🏠 In my spare time: I play around with the world of Home Assistant and contribute to open-source projects when I can.

Currenly building:
- VidScrl - a better way to view videos on your Mac
- ShareWords - expand your vocabulary as you read - no matter where or what you read!
- Dex-to-TickTick - A simple, local, Python-based integration to turn Dex PRM tasks into TickTick tasks.
