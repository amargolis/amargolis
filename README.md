# Hi there 👋  I'm Andy!

I love to build intuitive solutions to problems of all shapes and sizes. Public repos within are strictly personal projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: fun AI-powered things ;)
- 🏠 In my spare time: I play around with the world of Home Assistant and contribute to open-source projects when I can.
